#+TITLE: 海伦娜的庄园日记

** 海伦娜的庄园日记
　　或许，这会是最后一份记录了。
　　虽然在这里我未曾寻获关于创作的答案，但我所经历的，却足以成为日后我取之不尽的灵感源泉。
　　像所有冒险故事的开端一样，最开始一切并不顺利，那时这场“研讨”甚至算不上公平，这也让我充满不宅。
　　直到那个孩子的出现。
　　我们如此相似——都曾陷入缪斯的樊笼，
　　又如此不同一——即便我无比渴望，但却并未加他那般坦率的面对自我。
　　她重塑了我，就像当年的莎莉文老师一样，
 　　她们让这述雾般的旅程，显露出了光明的终点。
 　而作为那个越过终点的胜利者明天，我会带着我的“奖励”，离开这里，继续我的追求。
 　　这次，我将不再述茫。
** Helena's Manor Diary
Perhaps this will be the last entry of my records.
While I never found my answers about creation here, my experiences will serve as an infinite source of inspiration going forward.
Just like any story about adventures, things didn't go well in the beginning.
That "seminar" wasn't even fair, which made me anxious.
Until I met that child.
We're so much alike—both of us are trapped in muse's cage, 
yet we're so much different—despite that I wanted nothing more, I could never be as candid as she is to myself.
She reshaped me, just like Sullivan did back then.
They showed me the light at the end of a misty journey.
And as a winner who's crossed the finish line, I'll leave this place tomorow with my "reward" and continue with my pursuit.
I'll no longer be lost this time around.
